## We’ve grouped these methods into four phases

- [**Discover**](./discover/): Learn as much as you can about the project and people involved.
- [**Decide**](./decide/): Use what you’ve learned to start focusing your research on specific areas and groups of people.
- [**Make**](./make/): Move toward a final product that’s ready to be released and tested.
- [**Validate**](./validate/): Test your research, design, and product.

## We’ve called out specifics about doing this work in government

For the most part, the processes are the same as anywhere. However, to stay on the happy side of the law, take a look at [Recruiting](./fundamentals/recruiting/), [Incentives](./fundamentals/incentives/), and [Privacy](./fundamentals/privacy/). No matter which methods we work with, these are the [fundamentals](./fundamentals/) of our design research.
