title: Method Cards

## Why method cards?

A menu of available research methods will add rigor and structure to agile development
To help 18F and our partner agencies create a shared vocabulary around what each method entails
To help give less experienced or new researchers a gateway into well-documented and proven research methods, supported by other 18F team members.

## We have grouped these methods into four phases

- [Discover](./discover/): learn as much as you can about the project and people involved 
- [Decide](./define/): use what you’ve learned to start focusing your research on specific areas and groups of people
- [Make](./make/): move towards a final product that’s ready to be launched and tested
- [Validate](./validate/): start exploring and testing your focused research
