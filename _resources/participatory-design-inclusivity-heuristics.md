<h1>Participatory Design: Inclusivity Heuristics</h1>

<p>The following indicators can be used to help determine if a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/fundamentals/participatory-design">participatory design</a> process is proceeding in a way that encourages input from stakeholders and users. Indicators are spread across three broad categories: <a href="#account-for-context">Account for context</a>, <a href="#encourage-participation">Encourage participation</a>, and <a href="#inform-and-share-understanding">Inform and share understanding</a>.</p>

      <td class="col-why-it-matters"><p>Power dynamics shape all interpersonal relationships, as well as our collective ability to imagine potential futures. Power dynamics affect what’s considered possible, and the theories of change we will knowingly pursue.</p></td>
      <td class="col-good-signs"><p>Power is critically assessed. Team members understand who makes decisions and how (see “decision-making processes,” below). Team members in positions of power seldom exercise their power to limit debate (in other words, it practices forbearance). Team members in positions of lower power are able to hold their superiors to account without fear of reprisal. The team actively reduces power imbalances whenever possible; for example, by prioritizing product features for people who need them most (not necessarily building for the majority).</p></td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs"><p>Power is seldom discussed. Team members are unclear who makes decisions and how (see “decision-making processes,” below). Team members in positions of power often exercise their power to limit debate. Team members in positions of lower power remain silent due to “professionalism,” differences in status (for example, refraining from speaking for fear of humiliating someone with higher status), or fear of reprisal. The team exercises power without considering the people implicated in its decisions.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row" class="col-indicator"><p>Narratives</p></th>
      <td class="col-why-it-matters"><p>Narratives shape how we make sense of the world. Accounting for narratives helps teams see the difference between what is real and what is true, which encourages more diverse, accurate design.</p></td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team assesses its own narratives. For example, the team might reflect on the opportunities and experiences that have enabled them to participate in the current design process, such as having access to a computer from an early age, or having had positive interactions with existing systems of power (for example, government and law enforcement).</p>
        <p>The team considers related work completed prior to the team’s formation. For example, the team might: (1) interview prior teams (while being mindful of not asking them to relive past traumas); (2) interview folks who have been targets (“users”) of past design efforts; or (3) conduct a literary review. The team considers multiple business models to shape its direction, including cooperative business models and municipal ownership.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team does not assess its own narratives. The team assumes its own correctness, describing itself as innovative (especially without having created a sustainable innovation), or justifying its existence using “modernization” or “hero” narratives. The team erases the narratives of others; for example, by suggesting that all code written prior to its existence is “legacy code,” or by discounting prior efforts  without acknowledging the aspects of the priors that effort led to their failure (“we’ve tried that before”).</p>
        <p>The team does not consider how multiple business models might shape its future; instead, it treats narratives as an externality by deferring decisions to “the market.”</p>

      <th scope="row" class="col-indicator">Capacity</th>
      <td class="col-why-it-matters">
        <p>Differences in capacity (for example: physical, cognitive, emotional) affect people’s ability to participate in design processes and make use of designed products. Accounting for such differences results in work environments and work products that are more humane.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team respects the need for a healthy work-life balance. The team provides mechanisms for pausing and returning to discussions for people who need more time to process.</p>
        <p>The team designs for people at all levels of cognitive, emotional, and physical capacity. Designers encourage empathy for people with different levels of capacity using tools such as personas and stress cases. The team considers <a href="https://accessibility.18f.gov/">accessibility</a> throughout the design process and authors content using <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/plain-language/">plain language</a>. The team uses techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" rel="nofollow">progressive enhancement</a> and metrics like <a href="https://timkadlec.com/2013/01/setting-a-performance-budget/" rel="nofollow">performance budgets</a>.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team asks members to contribute at a level beyond that which is sustainable. The team often makes decisions under duress, and never aligns its design process within realistic constraints.</p>
        <p>The team perpetually de-prioritizes people whose needs are not met by its product or service but ostensibly could be (describing them as “edge cases”). The team’s product or service is designed to work for only a narrow subset of possible users, or only under specific circumstances (e.g., “desktop only.”)</p>

        <p>The team doesn’t have a vision, mission, or goals for their work, and doesn’t see value in creating one.

        <p>All design efforts are shaped by a series of decisions. Clearly stated and broadly understood principles and decision-making processes can help people understand how they can contribute to decisions, thus encouraging broader participation.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team states a clear decision-making process for substantial decisions, one in which people’s needs and ideas are respectfully considered and weighed. The team seeks to include people affected by decisions in the decision-making process. The team aligns its decision-making process with a set of design principles. The team provides mechanisms for pausing and returning to decisions for those who need more time to consider their choices.</p>

        <p>The team does not state a clear decision-making process for substantial decisions, or it over-bureaucratises this process. Decisions are either made inconsistently or by a group of elites outside of public view. The team actively avoids stating the design principles by which it makes decisions. People who are not party to the decision-making process are not encouraged to ask how or why decisions were made.</p>

      <th scope="row" class="col-indicator">
        <p>Collaborative culture</p>
      </th>
      <td class="col-why-it-matters">
        <p>Collaborative culture helps move the team’s focus away from individual team members (especially their egos, roles, etc.) and discrete work products that align with shared goals.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team focuses on ideas over individuals, and resists over-specialization among members. The team celebrates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Honesty">radical candor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...">generative thinking</a> (“Yes, and…”). The team relies on multiple modes of participation throughout the design process (for example, dot voting and design studio), and provides members with the skills and literacies they need to meaningfully contribute.</p>
        <p>The team proactively shares what everyone is working on by way of information-sharing rituals such as “ask me anything” events (AMAs), weekly team updates, status reports, or daily stand ups. The team uses tools and workflows where multiple authors can simultaneously contribute, such as GitHub, Slack, Murally, Google Docs, etc.</p>
        <p>If applicable, the team defines the terms under which its work can be reused (for example, in a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/">LICENSE.md</a> file), as well as information for people who wish to install the product locally, fork its code, or submit bug reports.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team encourages individualism and competition over collaboration. Conversations frequently center on the contributions or inadequacies of individual contributors, especially without those people present. The team defaults to a single mode of collaboration that doesn’t offer substantial input into the creative process (for example, choosing from a set of prefabricated designs). In places where team members might collaborate, no resources are devoted to helping members develop the skills and literacies they need to meaningfully contribute.</p>
        <p>The team does not proactively share what everyone is working on; people often work in private. The team strongly prefers that individuals work in isolation.</p>
        <p>The team never defines the terms or conditions under which its work can be reused or built upon.</p>

        <p>Shared glory</p>
      </th>
      <td class="col-why-it-matters">
        <p>Contributing to a participatory design processes is rarely given social currency; participants often have full time jobs doing something other than “design.” Celebrating individual contributors promotes a culture of appreciation, and encourages future contributions.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>Praise is freely given, and tailored to the contributor (some folks prefer public praise, while others prefer discrete praise). The team blogs about its work, acknowledging those who contributed to the team’s recent decisions or successes. The team internally praises contributors. The team doesn’t make any single member a spokesperson or evangelist. The team acknowledges, hires, and promotes people for their abilities across an array of diverse criteria rather than any single conception of value.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team operates a “meritocracy” in which only one type of labor or success is given credit. Team members routinely take credit for other people’s work, or ignore the licenses accompanying licensed work. The team doesn’t acknowledge or celebrate people who work, even behind the scenes, to ensure the team’s success.</p>

        <p>Emotional labor</p>
      </th>
      <td class="col-why-it-matters">
        <p>Emotional labor is the process of managing feelings to fulfill emotional requirements. A team’s capacity for emotional labor shapes the degree to which it can account for and respond to the feelings of others.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team actively works to understand the kinds of feelings for which it must account, and shares the burden of accounting for the feelings of others (for example, all new hires at Automattic are required to spend three weeks on the customer support team). Team members exhibit mindful use of language, including body language. Team members practice nonviolent communication, especially while discussing sensitive topics.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team relegates emotional labor to an unchanging minority of its members (e.g. design researchers, women, etc.), and does not factor the emotional burden it creates for others into its decision making processes. Team members are openly hostile to people and/or actively discount their needs or feelings.</p>

      <th scope="row" class="col-indicator"><p>Design research</p></th>
      <td class="col-why-it-matters"><p>Design research encourages teams to proactively engage with and account for the people affected by their product or service. Accounting for inclusivity within design research processes helps team to conduct better design research; for example, by ensuring that participants are treated with respect, teams might encourage participants to provide more honest feedback.</p></td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team identifies potential sources of bias before recruiting participants for research. The team proactively solicits feedback from people in lower positions of power, including people who are part of often-marginalized groups.</p>
        <p>The team uses multiple research methods (for example, <a href="/stakeholder-and-user-interviews">stakeholder and user interviews</a>, <a href="/usability-testing">usability testing</a>, <a href="/multivariate-testing">multivariate testing</a>, etc.) to collect diverse types of feedback. The team periodically shares what it’s learned by way of its research back with the participants whose data helped inform that understanding (for example, if a team conducts interviews to create a persona, the team might share their persona back with interviewees to ensure that it adequately captures their needs).</p>
        <p>The team’s design research studies conclude with a <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/02/06/getting-partners-on-board-with-research-findings/"><em>collaborative</em> synthesis process</a> in which all team members reach a shared understanding of the conclusions and recommendations that can be derived.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The designed service is seen as the ultimate subject of research, while users are seen as mere objects.</p>
        <p>The team intentionally skews or biases its research to yield post-facto rationalizations of foregone conclusions. The team does not expend energy to recruit broadly (for example, the team solicits input from friends or colleagues who aren’t actual users) and does not consider power dynamics in its recruiting and research. The team is overly protective or secretive about its research, and prohibits participants from knowing what data it collects or what conclusions it draws. The team conducts research without informed consent, or knowingly disrupts the flow of users.</p>
        <p>Design research is delegated to a subset of the team, who then periodically shares recommendations without meaningful context (such as quotes, videos, etc.).</p>

      <td class="col-why-it-matters">
        <p>Creating intentionally liminal (“transitory”) spaces actively suspends the norms under which the team operates, thus encouraging new ideas and critical thinking.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team regularly facilitates the creation of deliberative spaces to encourage lateral thinking; for example, <a href="../design-studios">design studios</a>, <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/" rel="nofollow">liberating structures</a>, or <a href="http://gamestorming.com/">gamestorming</a> sessions and collaborative sensemaking. The team regularly creates spaces where team and community members can critically reflect on recent decisions and the processes by which they were made; for example, retrospectives, critique groups, town halls, etc.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team seldom makes space for collaborative discussions, lateral thinking, or self reflection. Liminal spaces are not created in a prudent way; for example, the team never intends to act on self-critical discussions, or it only creates liminal spaces at the end of projects when it can no longer course-correct. Team members who join liminal spaces do not fully participate.</p>

        <p>Participatory design efforts become increasingly opaque as they mature; design decisions that were once widely understood may become less so as they disappear into the rearview. Accounting for a design effort’s history helps increase shared understanding, and encourages people to make more well informed decisions going forward.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-good-signs">
        <p>The team proactively attends to any potential lack of understanding its work may cause. The team pays down its <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt" rel="nofollow">“organizational debt”</a> so that its structures, rituals, decisions (audit trails), code, and experiments are understandable. The team promotes literacy at least inasmuch as it relates to the team’s work (for example, if the team’s work depends on understanding and setting up a virtual machine, the team might educate folks on how to setup a virtual machine). The team onboards everyone. (For example, this could be accomplished in part via a document like <a href="https://handbook.18f.gov">18F’s Handbook</a>.)</p>
      </td>
      <td class="col-warning-signs">
        <p>The team doesn’t attend to any potential lack of understanding its work may cause (“move fast and break things”). The team refuses to document its structures, rituals, decisions, code, and experiments in ways that are broadly understandable. The team does not account for its own onboarding experience; newcomers <em>must</em> pair with existing team members to setup their local environment and/or understand why and how the team functions.</p>
