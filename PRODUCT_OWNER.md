# 18F Methods Product Owner

As the 18F Methods Product Owner, you will be expected to spend an average of two hours a week working towards the following objectives:

## Objective A: Maintain the Methods

- Collaboratively set an achievable, year-long vision for the Methods that ideally also preserves them as a printed artifact that’s easily shared
- Identify, prioritize, and address short-term goals and known issues
- Optional: Establish a decision-making process(es) for merging contributions into the Methods (potentially using a set of design principles, etc.)

## Objective B: Ensure the Methods support and reflect 18F’s design practice

- In collaboration with the GSA Research Guild, collect data around 18F’s use of the Methods
- Revise and augment the Methods as needed, to keep in sync with 18F’s design practice
- Maintain the connections between the Methods and other content. For example, collaborate with the GSA Research Guild in its annual updating of the Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research (which links to the methods)

## Objective C: Encourage adoption of the Methods

- In collaboration with TTS Outreach, promote the methods outside of 18F
- Offer periodic support for methods on venues like the UX-COP Mailing list
- Optional: Encourage multiple perspectives around individual Methods (for example, ask guilds and chapters to host meetings around specific Methods)
