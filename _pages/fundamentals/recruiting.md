## What it is


## Why it is important


## Time required

1–2 weeks for 5–10 participants from mailing lists or community organizations

## Seek out people who:

- Are trying to use the thing you are working on right at that very moment.
- Recently tried to use the thing you are working on.
- Used the thing you are working on less recently.
- Have used something like what you are working on, and are likely to use what you are working on.

## Reach them through

- Relevant community organizations.
- Impromptu requests in or near the relevant environment.
- Your personal and professional network.
- The new or existing website.
- Existing mailing lists.

## Applied in government research

Check with your agency's legal counsel (or privacy officer or OIRA desk officer) before collecting any personally identifiable information or receiving services from the general public. For more on this, see OMB guidance on the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Privacy Act.
