## What it is

A way of finding themes in collections of ideas, quotes, or observations.

## Reasons to use it

To draw out insights from qualitative data quickly and collaboratively.

## Time required

**Small:** 1 hour

## How to do it

1. Record ideas, quotes, or observations from [interviews](/../discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/), [contextual inquiry](/../discover/contextual-inquiry/), or other sources of research on Post-It notes.

2. Place the Post-It notes on a white board (in no particular arrangement). Move the Post-It notes into related groups.

3. Use larger Post-It notes (or white board markers, if you are using a white board), to write titles or catch phrases for each group.

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. This method may use data gathered from members of the public, but does not require their involvement.
