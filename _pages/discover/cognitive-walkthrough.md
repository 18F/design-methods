## What it is

An evaluation method where users who are unfamiliar with a product work through a set of tasks and ask questions about the tasks as they go.

## Reasons to use it

To understand whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it's easy or difficult to learn.

## Time required

**Medium:** 30 minutes to one hour per person

## How to do it

1. Using [personas]({{ '/decide/personas/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), pick a couple pieces of specific knowledge that new or infrequent users might have.

2. Recruit three to five users for each of the identified pieces of knowledge to participate in a moderated usability testing session.

3. Based on user research, write down a set of tasks you can expect a new user to complete.

4. Ask the user to accomplish their goal using a printed or interactive design. As they go, ask what they would attempt to do next or how they would learn.
 - Don't lead the user through the task, but encourage them to stay focused on what they’re trying to accomplish.
 - Pay attention to expected outcomes and how quickly and easily participants are able to pick up a task.

5. Analyze the walkthrough results to highlight what users learned easily and what needs improvement.

## Applied in government research

-  No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that a cognitive walkthrough entails, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3.
-  If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
