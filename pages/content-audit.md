## What it is

A listing and analysis of all the content on an existing website (including pages, files, videos, audio or other data)


## Reasons to use it

To identify content that needs to be revised in new versions of a website. Content audits can also help you identify who is responsible for content, how often it should be updated, and what role a particular piece of content plays for users.


## Time to conduct

3-4 hours


How to do it[j]:[k][l]
Navigate through each page of the website, starting at the home page and note the following information about it:
-  Navigation title (the title used in the site’s navigation)
-  Page name (the title used on the page itself)
-  URL 
-  Parent (if the site is organized in a hierarchy, which page is “above” the current one)
-  Author(s) (the people who wrote the page)
-  Content owner(s) (the people who provide the content to the author)
-  Last updated date
-  Comments (a qualitative assessment of the content -- what needs to be added, removed or revised?)


## Applied in government research

-  No PRA implications. No information is being collected from members of the public.
