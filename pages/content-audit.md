## What it is

A listing and analysis of all the content on an existing website (including pages, files, videos, audio or other data) that your users might reasonably encounter.

## Reasons to use it

To identify content that needs to be revised in new versions of a website. Content audits can also help you identify who is responsible for content, how often it should be updated, and what role a particular piece of content plays for users.

## Time to conduct

3-8 hours

## How to do it

1. Start with an inventory. Navigate through the site from the home page and note the following about every piece of content. (For repeated items like blog posts, consider capturing just a sample.)
 - The title used in the site’s navigation for that page
 - The title used on the page or item itself
 - URL
 - Parent page, or for static files, what page it is linked from

2. Identify the main entry points for the user need you’re addressing. This could be external marketing, the homepage, a microsite, or another page. (If you're auditing a full website instead of specific needs, you may be able to skip this step and step 3.)

3. From each entry point, trace the tasks a user moves through until they address their need.

4. For every piece of content they might come across on that task flow, note:
 - Author(s): who wrote or created the page
 - Content owner(s): who is responsible for the substance
 - Updated date
 - Update frequency
 - Comments: qualitative assessment of what to add, remove, or revise
