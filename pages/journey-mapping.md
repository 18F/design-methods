## What it is

A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user’s experience of a product or service.

## Reasons to use it

To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a design system, helping them see the order, complexity, successes, pain points, and interactions that make up a user’s experience.

## Time required

**Medium:** 4–12 hours

## How to do it

1. Document the elements of the project’s design context. This includes:
 - People involved and their related goals;
 - Behaviors they exhibit (actions in pursuit of their goals);
 - Information, devices, and services they use (in service of their behaviors);
 - A set of discrete moments or major decisions they make;
 - The emotions associated with these moments or decisions. Emoticons or emoji work well here.

2. Create a visual map showing the order in which people exhibit behaviors, use information, make decisions, and have emotions. A few different approaches:
 - Group elements into a table of “phases” related to the personal narrative of each persona.
 - Create a graphic representation of this data by illustrating the narrative of each persona and where they share contextual components with one another.
 - A combination of the two.

3. Discuss the map with stakeholders. Point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish design principles. Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customer’s journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the project’s scope.

You can also map user journeys as part of a workshop with stakeholders, similar to a [design studio](../design-studio/).

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.5(h)3. Any user who participates will lead you through their journey their own way. See the methods for [Recruiting](../recruiting/) and [Privacy](../privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
