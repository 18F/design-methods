## What it is

An evaluation method in which evaluators or potential users who are unfamiliar with a design work through a set of representative tasks and ask questions about the task as they go.


## Reasons to use it

To understand whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it is or isn’t easy.

## Time to conduct

30 minutes to one hour per person

## How to do it

1. Determine the representative users that would be new users or infrequent users of a design solution.
2. Develop representative tasks a user would attempt that emphasis new use or infrequent use.
3. Recruit 3–5 users per user group that makes up the user population that are willing to participant in a moderated usability testing session.
4. Facilitate a walkthrough a solution  where probing questions focus on what people would initial attempt to do, or how they would learn how to navigate the solution to accomplish the tasks.  
 - Encourage the user the stay on task without leading them.
 - Pay attention to expected outcomes and how quickly/easily participants are able to pick up a task.
5. Present the analysis of the cognitive walkthrough that highlights the finding for how learnable the solution is and where areas of improvement can be made.

## Applied in government research

-  No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that [bodystorming](../bodystorming/) entails, 5 CFR 1320.5.(h)3.
-  If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
