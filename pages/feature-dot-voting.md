## What it is

A simple voting exercise to identify a group’s collective priorities for potential features or user stories.

## Reasons to use it

To build group consensus quickly from the priorities of individual in the group.

## Time to conduct

15 minutes

## How to do it

1. Bring plenty of Post-It notes and “glue dots” to the meeting.

2. Gather all people on the product team and anyone with a stake in the product’s features.

3. Quickly review the project’s goals and conclusions of any prior user research.

4. Ask team members to take five minutes to write important features or user needs on sticky notes. (One feature per sticky note.)

5. After five minutes, ask participants to put their stickies on a board. If there are many sticky notes, ask participants to put their features next to similar ones. Remove exact duplicates.

6. Give participants three to five glue dots and instruct them to place their dots on features they feel are most important to meeting project goals and user needs.

7. Identify the features with the largest number of dots (votes).

## Applied in government research

Likely no PRA implications: generally participants are stakeholders and government employees. If participants are employees, the PRA does not apply. If they are members of the public, any given session will likely have fewer than nine users, in which case the PRA does not apply, 5 CFR 1320.5(c)4. See the methods for [Recruiting](../recruiting/) and [Privacy](../privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
