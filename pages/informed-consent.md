## What it is

Making sure research participants understand what research activities will require, getting explicit confirmation that they agree to it, and giving them the right to withdraw consent (and hence participation) at any point, without penalty.

## Why it is important

Informed consent is the cornerstone of ethical research practice. Always. If you plan to share any data publicly, especially personally identifiable information (often called P.I.I.), you must get participants’ express permission to do so — no exceptions.

## Time to conduct

5 minutes per participant

## How to do it:

1. **Explain to potential participants what the research will entail.** Why are you doing it? What will they do? How long will it take? What kind of data will you collect? With whom, and how, do you want to share that data?

2. **Ask them directly to say yes or no.** This usually happens in writing, but it can happen in conversation if the participant is illiterate or if the interaction is so lightweight/quick that getting full, written consent would take longer than the activity itself.

3. **Respect any request to withdraw.**

4. **Waive their right to compensation.** Beyond incentives, participants need to acknowledge that their participation is a gratuitous contribution.

## Applied in government research:
No PRA implications. The PRA specifically exempts consents, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)1.
