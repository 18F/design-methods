## What it is

Our obligation to keep data about research participants secure. Covered by laws like the Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act and eGovernment Act.

## Why it is important

You have a moral, legal, and ethical obligation to protect people's privacy. Also, if people do not believe you will protect their privacy, they will be unlikely to participate in your research.

## How to do it:
1. **Wherever possible, avoid collecting personally identifiable information (PII).** Avoid collecting or storing information, like names, addresses or phone numbers, that could be used to connect a particular person to your research. Consider making your research notes anonymous and minimizing the amount of personally identifiable information you record about people during scheduling.

2. **When you store personally identifiable information, comply with all the legal requirements.** For PII obtained by government employees, these requirements include:
 - Limiting access to the information to people who need to use it.
 - Encrypting the information, especially when it’s stored on mobile devices
 - Keep the PII on government systems and avoid storing it in insecure locations. For instance, avoid using USB thumb drives.

3. **Clear new systems that collect participant information for privacy implications.** Information systems that hold information about members of the public or employees likely need to go through your agency’s privacy impact processes. For more on the privacy process, please see [OPM’s Privacy Impact Assessment](https://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/privacy-references/piaguide.pdf) (or that of your agency).
