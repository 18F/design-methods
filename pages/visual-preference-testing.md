## What it is

A method that allows potential users to review and provide feedback on a solution’s ultimate visual direction.

## Reasons to use it

To align the established branding guidelines and attributes of a solution with the way end users view the overall brand and emotional feel.

## Time to conduct

4-12 hours for mood boards or [style tiles](../style-tiles/). 30 minutes per participant to get feedback.

## How to do it

1. Create iterations of a mood board or style tile that represent directions a final visual design may follow. If branding guidelines or attributes don’t exist, establish them with stakeholders beforehand.

2. Ask questions as objectively as possible. Align questions with the branding guidelines and attributes your project must incorporate.

3. As far as possible, allow participants to provide their feedback unmoderated or at the end of a research study.

4. Compare the results with the published branding guidelines and attributes that an agency has already put in place.

5. Publish the results to the complete product team and decide which direction will guide future design efforts.

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.5(h)3. See the methods for [Recruiting](../recruiting/) and [Privacy](../privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
