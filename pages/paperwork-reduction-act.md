title: Paperwork Reduction Act

## What it is

A common, but misguided, rationale for avoiding certain design research methods. Full name: The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The intent of the PRA is to prevent government paperwork from overburdening the public. By empowering the Office of Management and Budget to review how agencies collect standardized information, it also improves government statistics. Because it focuses on burden and statistics, you can set up most activities in ways that do not require review.

## Why it doesn’t stand in your way

1. **None of the methods we’ve described in this set require PRA approval.** The PRA requires special approval for agencies asking identical questions to ten or more users (5 CFR 1320.3c). If conducted as described here, none of these methods require PRA clearance. They either do not require asking identical questions of more than nine participants or don’t require asking identical questions of each participant.

2. **Only a narrow set of research methods requires PRA approval.** Large surveys as well as highly structured focus groups or interviews all will ask identical questions to more than nine people and thus require approval.

3. **Even research that involves asking many people identical questions may not require approval.** The following activities are explicitly excluded from the PRA (5 CFR 1320.3h):
 - Research conducted by _certain agencies_ including the Federal Election Commission, General Accounting Office or government-owned, contractor-run facilities (like national laboratories).
 - Requests for _general feedback_ (e.g. a survey that asks a question like “What do you think?” instead of asking more specific questions).
 - Research designed to be _tests of “aptitude or abilities,”_ not gather facts or opinions (e.g. a published online quiz to test knowledge about a certain agency)
 - Information obtained at _public meetings_.
