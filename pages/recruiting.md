## What it is

Identifying and gathering people to interview or who will test your product.

## Why it is important

Time spent with the right people using the wrong methods is better than time spent with people who aren’t your core users but follow the right methods. Recruiting people who represent your core user group is a critical and oft-overlooked part of research.

## Time required

1–2 weeks for 5–10 participants from mailing lists or community organizations

## Who you should seek

- People who are trying to use the thing you are working on right at that very moment.
- People who have recently tried to use the thing you are working on.
- People who have used the thing you are working on less recently.
- People who have used a thing like the thing you are working on and are likely to use the thing you are working on.

## How you can reach them

- Through relevant community organizations.
- Using guerrilla intercepts near where people do the thing you are working on.
- In your personal and professional network.
- Via the new or existing website.
- Via existing mailing lists.

## Applied in government research

When you recruit users who are not government employees, complying with the Anti-Deficiency Act requires you to either:  

- Give all members of the public an opportunity to participate (by posting the opportunity to participate somewhere everyone can see it, like your website or Github), or
- Get participants to agree, in writing, to the statement: “I understand that I will receive no compensation and waive all claims for compensation from the U.S. government in exchange for my participation in this research.”

If you do not ask potential participants to respond to a “screener survey,” the PRA does not apply to your recruiting efforts.
