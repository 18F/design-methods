## What it is

Offering research participants gifts to encourage participation and to thank them for their time.

## Why it is important

Incentives often result in a more diverse, representative set of participants. Without incentives, you often end up recruiting people with a strong intrinsic interest in your website. These people may not have the same needs and experiences as a less interested but larger pool of users. With incentives, you can encourage less interested, more representative people to participate.

## How to do it

1. **Identify an appropriate incentive.** The best incentives are large enough to encourage participation, but not so large that they seem inappropriate. In industry, cash incentives are usually comparable to the hourly rate of the people recruited. In government, incentives are often smaller, non-cash gifts.

2. **Clearly communicate when and how participants will receive incentives.** In the emails, postings or other materials you use to recruit your participants, describe the incentive and how participants will receive it (via mail, pick up at an office, etc.). This is particularly important for “remote” research.

3. **Distribute incentives to participants who show up.** Give incentives to any participant who arrives for the study. If they arrive but choose not to participate after learning more about your study, they should still receive an incentive. Otherwise, your incentive could coerce participants uncomfortable with the research to participate.
