## What it is

Written statements, generally in the form of imperatives like “Earn people’s trust,” that serve as guiding lights during decision-making, helping teams generate and then evaluate proposed ideas. 
 
## Reasons to use it

To give the team and the stakeholders a shared point of reference when negotiating next steps. Good design principles are specific to the project, not general truths, and should help teams say “no” to otherwise interesting proposals, or generate ideas when they are stuck. 

## Time to conduct

A week, plus occasional refresher meetings 
 
## How to do it

1. From internal documents and kickoff activities, gather terms or concepts that seem significant to project goals and organizational culture. 
2. From observational and desk research, synthesize terms or concepts that seem particularly important to customer or user groups. 
3. Cluster those terms and concepts into groups on a whiteboard or other writing space open to everyone in the project. Name the groups.
4. Ask the entire group if they would like to add, change, or edit any concepts or groups.
5. Sythensize[q] 3 – 5 final principles from what’s on the board. What evidence from partner or user research supports each? Using that evidence, write 1-2 sentences in support of each principle. 
6. Share the principles in a place accessible to the team throughout the project, and refer to them often while making decisions.
 
## Applied in government research

- No PRA implications. Even when users are present, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that bodystorming entails, 5 CFR 1320.5.(h)3.
- If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
