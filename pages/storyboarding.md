## What it is

A visual sequence of a specific use case or scenario, coupled with a narrative.

## Reasons to use it

To visualize interactions and relationships that might exist between a user and a solution in the context of the user’s full experience.

## Time to conduct

1–2 days depending on the complexity of the scenario(s)

## How to do it

1. Gather any documents that describe the different use cases or [scenarios](../user-scenarios/) in which users will interact with the solution.
2. Sketch scenes that visually depict a user interacting with a solution, including as much context  as possible. For example: Are they mobile? Where are they? What else is in their environment?
3. Annotate each scene with a description of what the user is attempting to do. Describe what general feeling or experience the team wants the user to have.
4. Review the storyboard with the product team and stakeholders for feedback. Iterate until the storyboard represents a shared vision of the scenario/progression of scenes.
5. Document the work with a high fidelity version of the storyboard if you plan to use the storyboard for separate future work or in other external contexts.
