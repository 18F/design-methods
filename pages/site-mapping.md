## What it is

A comprehensive rendering of how a website’s pages relate to one another.

## Reasons to use it

To audit an existing website by assessing its structure and content. Site maps also help you plan and organize the contents of a new website prior to [wireframing](../wireframing/) and building it.

## Time required

**Small:** 2–3 hours

## How to do it

1. List each page of a website or section.

2. Arrange the pages in order of hierarchy as they appear. Reconstruct the website as a flat, static map of all its pages.

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
