## What it is

A collection of ui elements used frequently across a design solution, consisting of the base patterns and helpful information about how to use them examples of the pattern being implemented, and rationale on what the pattern is, how it should be used, and why it’s a good pattern. Sample code snippets can also be included to aid in front end development.


## Reasons to use it

To aid in designing a solution that uses ui elements consistently. Maintaining a set of approved, reusable patterns makes it easier to produce new features or updates to the current solution.  

## How to do it

1. Start as early as possible, as new design elements are being created and approved for use. On approval, capture each pattern, what it’s meant to accomplish, how it should be used, and any data as to why it’s good for the end user.
2. Specify the components that make up each pattern and note possible constraints or restrictions. 
3. Describe how someone will use the pattern and how it should respond to the user. Specify differences between states (for example: how a button renders on load, hover, and click).
4. Include any code or snippets that front end developers can use to implement the pattern. 
5. Provide examples of the pattern being implemented to show how the same pattern could or would work in different solutions. 
6. Publish the design pattern library in an open, accessible space where the project team can use and extend it. (One common implementation of a design pattern is in a wiki[r].)
