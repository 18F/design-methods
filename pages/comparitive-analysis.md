## What it is

A detailed review of either by direct competitors or by related agencies or services.  

## Reasons to use it

To identify competitorsâ€™ solutions that excel, are lacking, or are missing critical design elements. Comparative analysis can  give new solutions a competitive edge by identifying areas of opportunity, gaps in experience offerings, and potential design patterns to adopt or avoid. 

## Time to conduct

1 - 2 hours per identified competitor. 1 hour to analyze each competitor. 4 - 8 hours total to generate a report.

## How to do it

1. Identify a list of services or agencies that would be either direct or related competitors to the service or client[g] agency. Pare the list down to four or five competitors. 
2. Establish which heuristics you will use to evaluate each service or agency offering.
3. Break down the analysis into specific focal areas that will be evaluated for each selected service or agencies offering. For example, Search Results
4. Complete a Google Sheets worksheet to capture the evaluation and determine how the targeted services and agencies perform based on the identified heuristics. 
5. Present the analysis which should showcase any areas of opportunities that can be taken advantage of and design patterns which should be adopted or avoided. 

## Applied in government research

-  No PRA implications. Even when users are present, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that bodystorming entails, 5 CFR 1320.5.(h)3. 
-  If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
