## What it is

An observation by all parts of the product team of users in context accompanied by questions to better understand their behavior.

## Reasons to use it

To understand how and why users do (and don’t do) what they do in their own environments; to discover needs and attitudes that might not emerge in an interview format; to understand more fully when and how digital workflows touch other workflows; and to build empathy with users.

This method is especially useful if subjects have concerns about the time required for a sit-down interview, or their work involves many or complex interactions with the product or solution that the project focuses on. It’s also useful for hardware/software discovery.

## Time to conduct

1-2 hours per user

## How to do it

1. Identify users to observe. Get permission (with government users, it is important to respect the supervisory hierarchy), schedule a time, and provide plenty of friendly reminders. Before the meeting, learn the dress code or other requirements to blend in.
2. Bring a pen, notebook, recording device, and a phone or camera to the user’s work environment.
3. Assign one researcher per user and ask for permission to record the session. Build rapport with users by telling them the reason for your research. Ask them to explain their work as though they were training a new employee.
4. Ask the user to carry out their tasks as usual. Let them know that you will occasionally interrupt them with questions to better understand what they are doing and why. (Be polite, of course.)
5. Ask lots of “how” questions, or keep asking “why is that?” to get deeper insights.
6. At the end of the session, explain what you have learned. Ask users to point out anything that you may have misunderstood.
7. Immediately after the interview, write up your notes. Use the research to inform other tools like journey mapping, task flow analysis, and personas.

## Applied in government research

-  No PRA implications, if done properly. Contextual interviews should be non-standardized, conversational, and based on observation. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.5.(h)3. See the methods for Recruiting and Privacy for more tips on taking input from the public.
-  For internal folk, get permission from the right level of management. If participants could be under union agreements, contact the agency’s labor relations team.

## Example from 18F

A pair of 18F team members visited two Department of Labor/Wage Hour Division investigators as they interviewed home health care workers who were subject to unpaid overtime and other infractions. Since it was a sensitive subject, the 18F team did not question the health care workers directly, but instead asked the investigators clarifying questions in private. 18F staff also made sure that photos did not include faces.
