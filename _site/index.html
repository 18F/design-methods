              <dd><ol>
  <li>Gather 3-6 members of the project team who are ready to think on their feet. If possible, identify a few users who can play along. </li>
  <li>Bringing the project team to the user&rsquo;s environment is ideal, but a conference room that models the user&rsquo;s environment could also work. </li>
  <li>Assign each member of the project team to a role, interface, or &ldquo;touchpoint,&rdquo; identified in the journey map. If users are present, ask them to pretend to accomplish their goals in their usual way. If users are absent, assign a persona to each member of the product team that isn&rsquo;t serving as a touchpoint. </li>
  <li>Role play how users accomplish their goals using props. &ldquo;Speak the interface&rdquo; to one another. For example, one of the touchpoints might say &ldquo;Submit all of your required forms,&rdquo; and the user might respond &ldquo;Arg! I don&rsquo;t know what forms are required!&rdquo; </li>
  <li>Review the exercise as a team and document the opportunities/challenges that this exercise suggests.</li>
  <li>If you anticipate discomfort from participants, assign roles beforehand and start with a basic script.</li>

  <li>Travel to the user’s work environment (or setup time for remote research). Bring a pen, notebook, recording device, and a phone or camera.</li>
  <li>Assign one researcher per user and ask for permission to record the session. Build rapport with users by telling them the reason for your research. Ask them to explain their work as though they were training a new employee. </li>
  <li>Ask the user to carry on with their tasks as usual. Let them know that you will be occasionally interrupting them with questions to better understand what they are doing and why. (Be polite, of course.)</li>
  <li>Ask lots of “how” questions, or keep asking “why is that?” to get deeper insights. </li>
  <li>At the end of the session, explain what you have learned. Ask users to point out anything that you may have misunderstood.</li>
  <li>Immediately after the interview, write up your notes. Consider what outputs would best benefit from the research. User Journey, Persona, etc. </li>

              <dt>How</dt>
              <dd><p>Work with your team to collaboratively craft a problem statement: </p>

<blockquote><p>We have observed that [product/service/organization] isn’t meeting [these goals/needs], which is causing [this adverse effect]. How might we improve so that our team/organization is more successful based on [these measurable criteria]?</p></blockquote>

<p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our success metrics are often the same metrics that make us appear good at our job. But being good at our job isn’t enough. Research keeps us vigilant by helping us see and hear things from the perspective of our users.</li>
  <li>Use personas to identify users’ skills, practices, and behaviors. Decide which of these you want to promote (and how you would measure that). Next, look at your persona’s pain points and consider how you would alleviate them (and how you would measure that).</li>
  <li>Anonymously collect your teammates’ greatest hopes as well as their greatest fears. Print these out, group them by topic, and discuss. Think about ways of measuring, throughout the project, whether or not the project is aligning with your collective hopes or deviating towards your collective fears.</li>

    At the meeting: 
    <ol>
      <li>Review the design prompt and research shared.</li>
      <li>Distribute paper and drawing materials to everyone. Ask participants to individually sketch concepts that address the prompt. Remind them that anyone can draw and artistic accuracy is not the goal of the exercise. 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>In groups of three, have participants present their ideas to one another and solicit critiques.</li>
      <li>Ask the groups of three to create a design(s) that combines the best aspects of their individual member’s contributions. </li>

              <dd><p>To passively explore a user’s perspective, over time. This is especially useful for situations that require users to adapt their approach based on feedback from their environment, such as when they’re learning to use a new piece of software.</p></dd>

              <dd></dd>
              <dt>How</dt>
              <dd><ol>
  <li>Determine the duration of the process you'd like to gain insight into, how often you’ll ask users to write entries, as well as the format their entries should take (open-ended, text-based formats are the logical choice, but you might also consider handwritten notebooks, narrated videos, or photos with commentary).</li>
  <li>Recruit users by asking them to opt in. Many forms of research have designers sit alongside users while they’re accomplishing a task. Diary studies are a bit different because they’re spread out over time. Diary studies shouldn’t be thought of as a chore that’s above and beyond someone’s already busy schedule (though they are), so it’s important to recruit people who are excited to share their thoughts.</li>
  <li>Send participants prompts at regular intervals throughout the study. Consider periodically checking in on participants to see how they’re feeling. </li>
  <li>Synthesize the research as it’s collected rather than waiting until the end of the study.</li>
</ol>
<p>Diary studies conducted ahead of in-person interviews allow researchers to poke deeper into certain response areas and ask follow-up questions.</p>

  <li>Determine a focus question (e.g., what did we learn from the usability study?) and assign a facilitator.</li>
  <li>Gather at least 4 participants for 90 minutes. Give sticky notes (in at least two different colors) and sharpies to everyone. </li>
  <li>Ask participants the focus question and give them five minutes to think of at least three responses. Put each response on its own sticky note.</li>
  <li>Give participants 15 minutes puts their sticky notes up on the wall and read everyone’s contributions. Additions can be made at any time.</li>
  <li>Have participants group like items without any discussion of the sticky notes or the groups. </li>
  <li>Using a different colored sticky note, ask each individual to name each group. Each group must have a name, but you may realize that a group could be split into two. The only time you’re excused from giving a group a name is if someone has already used the exact words you had intended to use.</li>
  <li>Remind the group of the original focus question. Each person writes down their three most important groups in order of priority. Assign 3 votes to 1st priority, 2 votes to 2nd priority, and 1 vote to 3rd priority, which totals 6 votes over 3 topics. These votes should be visually tallied on the clusters, with either stickers or pen marks.</li>
  <li>Eliminate any duplicate areas, but only if the group unanimously agrees that they are identical. Every time two items are combined, their votes are added together. Usually, you reach a point where there are three or four items which are ranked much higher than the rest. These are the top priorities for the focus question.</li>

              <dd><p>Personas are usually created as part of the analysis of the data generated from a team’s contextual inquiry and stakeholder interviews.  Teams can certainly create placeholder personas in the absence of this research, but they’re effectively stereotyping users. Placeholder personas are nevertheless useful for getting a team to think critically about its users, but they should not be used to inform design decisions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gather your research in a way that’s easy to review.</li>
  <li>Create a set of user archetypes based on how you believe people will make use of your solution. These typically take an active title (e.g., “data administrators” versus “those who submit data”).</li>
  <li>Analyze your records for patterns as they relate to user archetypes. Specifically note frequently observed goals/motivations, behaviors, and pain points.</li>
  <li>Pair recurring goals, behaviors, and pain points with archetypes. Give each archetype a name as well as a fictional account of their day. Add a photo of someone who fits the description, but ideally not an image of someone you’ve actually interviewed and who may be recognized.</li>
  <li>Link your personas to the research that inspired them. This is useful when researchers are interested in challenging the way a persona stereotypes a user.</li>  
</ol>
<p>Note: Unlike marketing personas, which are often created based on demographics and marketability, design personas are tools describing how someone goes about accomplishing their goals. </p>

              <dd><p>Prototypes allow designers to create a bridge between (1) their ability to execute, (2) their developer’s perceived limitations regarding the interface, and (3) their stakeholders’ feedback. Before beginning, prototypers must first consider the appropriate level of fidelity that will create a space in which all three of these parties can benefit. Some designers opt for “static” prototypes, using paper and simulating interaction; others actually go so far as to mockup an interface in InVision or to code a version of their interface in HTML and CSS. Regardless, the point is to create something that’s highly malleable that can change in response to feedback (via usability testing, say).</p>

              <dt>How</dt>
              <dd><p>Start with either your personas or the raw data from contextual inquiry you have performed.</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the perspective of each user, persona, or stakeholder, list each question that those people have around your inquiry area on sticky notes—one question per sticky. Use different colors for each persona type.</li>
  <li>Add in your own questions on sticky notes in a new color (If you don’t have that many colors, try cutting them into shapes, adding unique borders, or labeling them in another way).</li>
  <li>Cluster related questions. </li>  
</ol>
<p>At this point, you will notice how questions from different stakeholders relate or diverge from one another. This can create consensus among different groups (users vs management) but also illuminate very different perspectives in some cases.</p>

              <dd><p>These interviews typically last for about an hour and are conducted either one-on-one, or two-on-one with an additional note-taker or joint interviewer.</p>
<p>Come to the interview with an guide for yourself of some question areas you’d like to ask about, and some specific questions as a back up. Once you introduce yourself and start the interview, follow the conversational direction that the stakeholder leads you in. What they focus on will be insightful to their priorities and interests. Don’t get entirely off course though, your interview guide will help you make sure that you are checking in on what you need to. Questions will often fall in categories around the individual and their role, the organization, the individuals’ needs, and metrics for success of the project. Possible starters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
  <li>Ask lots of "why is that" and "how" questions. Be comfortable with long silences which will allow the stakeholder to elaborate on their own.</li>
  <li>If there are other products they use or your product is greenfield then observe them using a competing product.</li>

              <dd><ol>
  <li>
    Create a prototype that sufficiently conveys the team’s hypothesis based on research. In the absence of a prototype, consider testing a competitor’s product.
  </li>
  
</ol>
<li>
  <p>Stage a scenario in which someone who would actually use your product tries to employ the prototype for their own ends. Record their attempt. Optionally: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask users to think out loud.</li>
    <li>Pay the participant for their time.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Analyze the user’s attempt to employ your prototype, looking especially for areas where they struggled or questions they asked to inform design changes.</li>  
<p>While designers concern ourselves with the design of products and services, regular people use products and services to achieve their own goals (i.e., they don’t care about design). For this reason, it’s not really a good idea to offer test participants a large incentive or to take them far outside of their normal usage context. If you are a voter registration group testing a new layout for your website’s “user account section,” for example, you’d ideally recruit test participants who were already registering to vote online. You’d specifically want to avoid testing with voters who were unfamiliar with the website. Asking people to change their existing behavior for the purposes of a test will cause them to reflect and comment on the design rather than their ability to accomplish their goals in a way that’s familiar to them.</p>

              <dt>How</dt>
              <dd><p>Wireframes are blueprints. Steer clear of font choices, color, or other style choices. A few helpful tools for building wireframes are OmniGraffle and Balsamiq Mockups, which purposefully keep the wireframe looking like rough sketches. These are conceptually easier to re-configure than a design that looks very polished.</p> 
<p>While making wireframes, it is useful to keep personas—and, specifically, their goals—in mind. Can people accomplish their tasks given the design you’re suggesting?</p>
