## Welcome!

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you’re unsure about something, feel free to submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you’ll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions and questions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## How to contribute

### Where to submit a pull request

Submit pull requests to the `staging` branch. This is the main branch of Methods. If you’re not sure how to submit a pull request, feel free to submit an issue and we will try to address it ourselves.

### What to include in a pull request

Including these will help us be faster and better at responding.

- **Changes:** a list, preferably bulleted, of what you’re changing
- **Notes:** anything that might help us understand the change, like why you’re doing it or alternative approaches you tried
- **Screenshots:** if your pull request will affect layout or interaction, to show us what you’re fixing or changing

### What to include in an issue

Not all of these will apply to all issues. But when they do, it’s very helpful to see them (special thanks to @ondrae for [the suggestion of this list](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/issues/15#issuecomment-129552978)).

- **Description:** okay, this one does apply to all issues. :)
- **How to reproduce:** if your issue is a bug, any information about how we can see it ourselves
- **Screenshots:** similarly, so we can see what you’re seeing
- **Files:** anything with helpful information about the issue
- **To dos:** if your issue is an enhancement, a list of improvements or steps to help us meet the goal of the enhancement

### Labels

In addition to standard labels (`bug`, `question`, etc.) we have created a few labels unique to Methods. Use them on both pull requests and issues.

- `copy edit` denotes changes to language, which tells us we need to make the change twice: in the digital version and on the printable method cards.
- `new method` tells us you are submitting a design research method that we don’t currently describe.
- `print cards` is for design changes to the printable cards that may require a bit more time from an 18F visual designer to address.

### Before you submit content edits

Please review the Methods [content editing checklist](https://github.com/18F/methods/wiki/content-editing-checklist). We’re trying to keep the style and structure consistent, so we’ll check contributions against this guide anyway. Might as well check beforehand! If you’d rather just call our attention to something that seems off, go ahead and file an issue and we’ll review the checklist as part of our edits.

## What we do with contributions

We regularly review all pull requests and issues.  We merge pull requests into `staging` as soon as we can.

Once a week, we incorporate any staged copy edits into the files for the printed cards, also on `staging`. We then merge all changes from `staging` into `master` — code and copy, digital and print. You’ll see your change reflected on [methods.18f.gov](https://methods.18f.gov/) after that pull into `master`.

We leave issues and pull requests open until we have decided what to do and then actually done it. Any time we close an issue, you’ll see something that explains why we’re closing it (such as a comment, a merged pull request, or a reference to another issue).
