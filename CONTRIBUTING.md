## Suggesting new Methods
We accept suggestions for additions to the Methods through a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnW3KyP3j6EkrwKeMQ2v9n_rQRJVn7xm_5aNpyXG5w4UtEEA/viewform?usp=sf_link). We use four primary criteria to evaluate all new Method proposals. 
18F Methods should be:
* **Tried and true:** It’s been used on more than one 18F project 
* **Succinct how-tos:** Think activity, not philosophy
* **Foundational:** Context-agnostic and unique
* **For non-experts:** Accessible and relevant to a broad audience
