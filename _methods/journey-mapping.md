category: Decide
what: A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user&rsquo;s experience of a product or service.
why: To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a service that helps them see the sequence of interactions that make up a user’s experience including the complexity, successes, pain points, and emotions users experience along the way.
timeRequired: 4–12 hours
how:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Document the elements of the project&rsquo;s design context. This includes&#58;
      <ul>
        <li>People involved and their related goals</li>
        <li>Their behaviors in pursuit of their goals</li>
        <li>Information, devices, and services that support their behaviors</li>
        <li>Important moments in how they experience a service or major decisions they make</li>
        <li>The emotions associated with these moments or decisions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Visualize the order in which people exhibit behaviors, use information, make decisions, and feel emotions. Group elements into a table of &ldquo;phases&rdquo; related to the personal narrative of each <a href="/personas">persona</a>. Identify where personas share contextual components.</li>
    <li>Discuss the map with stakeholders. Point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish <a href="/design-principles">design principles</a>. Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customer&rsquo;s journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the project&rsquo;s scope.</li>
  </ol>
