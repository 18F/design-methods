title: Journey mapping
category: Decide
what: A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user’s experience of a product or service.
why: To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a design system, helping them see the order, complexity, successes, pain points, and interactions that make up a user’s experience.
timeRequired: 4–12 hours
how:
  - Document the elements of the project’s design context. This includes:
    - People involved and their related goals
    - Their behaviors in pursuit of their goals
    - Information, devices, and services that support their behaviors
    - Discrete moments or major decisions they make
    - The emotions associated with these moments or decisions
  - Visualize the order in which people exhibit behaviors, use information, make decisions, and feel emotions. Group elements into a table of “phases” related to the personal narrative of each [persona]({{ '/decide/personas/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Identify where personas share contextual components.
  - Discuss the map with stakeholders. Point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish [design principles]({{ '/decide/design-principles/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customer’s journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the project’s scope.
governmentConsiderations: No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3. See the methods for [Recruiting]('/fundamentals/recruiting') and [Privacy]('/fundamentals/privacy') for more tips on taking input from the public.
