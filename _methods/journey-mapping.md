category: Decide
what: A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user's experience of a product or service.
why: To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a service that helps them see the sequence of interactions that make up a user’s experience including the complexity, successes, pain points, and emotions users experience along the way.
timeRequired: 4–12 hours
how: |
  1. Document the elements of the project's design context. This includes&#58;
    - People involved and their related goals
    - Their behaviors in pursuit of their goals
    - Information, devices, and services that support their behaviors
    - Important moments in how they experience a service or major decisions they make
    - The emotions associated with these moments or decisions
  2. Visualize the order in which people exhibit behaviors, use information, make decisions, and feel emotions. Group elements into a table of "phases" related to the personal narrative of each [persona](/decide/personas/#personas). Identify where personas share contextual components.
  3. Discuss the map with stakeholders. Point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish [design principles](/decide/design-principles/#design-principles). Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customer's journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the project's scope.
