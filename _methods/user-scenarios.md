title: User scenarios
description: Stories and context &mdash; focused on identifying the what, who, how, and why &mdash; behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.
category: Decide
what: Stories and context &mdash; focused on identifying the what, who, how, and why &mdash; behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.
why: To remind a team, during both the design and validation phases, of the overarching goal(s) that users have when interacting with a solution. Scenarios help the team consider the design of the solution as a whole rather than getting caught up by specific pages, elements, or interactions. They note questions and goals and sometimes define the possibilities of how the user(s) can achieve them.
timeRequired: 1-3 hours
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Identify the target user group and any common user goals and scenarios that a person must go through when interacting with a solution.</li>  
    <li>
      Decide which type of scenario you&rsquo;re going to write.
      <ul>
        <li>Goal or task-based. Short and specific, focus on the core aspects of the goal or task.</li>
        <li>Elaborate. Provide additional details about the environment and context.</li>
        <li>Full scale. Include various steps a user needs to take as well as their environment and context.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Describe why it&rsquo;s important for a user to be able to accomplish their goal or complete the scenario.</li>
    <li>Share with the full team for feedback and refinement.</li>
    <li>If you want to use the scenarios for <a href="/usability-testing">usability testing</a>, write them so they do not lead the participant to the correct outcome.</li>
  </ol>
