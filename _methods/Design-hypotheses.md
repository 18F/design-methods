title: Design hypothesis
permalink: /decide/design-hypothesis/
description: A listing and analysis of all the content on an existing website (including pages, files, videos, audio or other data) that your users might reasonably encounter.
category: Decide
what: Framing your work as a hypothesis means no longer just thinking about the thing you&rsquo;re making or building, but paying more attention to whether that work is achieving your intended goals and outcomes.

  This in turn means thinking about your work as a series of experiments you do with your users to learn if you&rsquo;re on the right path. Instead of asking &ldquo;Did we ship the shopping cart feature?&rdquo; you ask&#58; &ldquo;Did we make it easier and simpler for our customers to buy from us?&rdquo;

why: When done collaboratively, hypothesis-building is powerful at getting a team on the same page about what it’s doing and why. It also allows the team to be flexible &mdash; if one approach doesn’t result in the outcome you expected, you have implicit permission to change course and try something else.
timeRequired: 1-2 hours
how:
  <ol>
    <li>As a team, identify and make explicit the problem you’re trying to solve. What goals or needs aren’t being met? What measurable criteria would indicate progress toward those goals?</li>
    <li>
      <p>As a team, write out the hypothesis for the work you want to do to address the problem(s) you’re trying to solve. You may want to write broad hypotheses at the outset of a project and more specific hypotheses each sprint.</p>
      <p>Here’s a common way to structure your hypothesis:</p>
      <p><em>We believe that doing/building/creating [this] for [this user] will result in [this outcome]. We’ll know we’re right when we see [this metric/signal].</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Identify the main entry points for the user need you&rsquo;re addressing. This could be external marketing, the homepage, a microsite, or another page.</li>
    <li>Build or do the thing, and measure. If you learned something unexpected, then create a new hypothesis and change course so you can continue working toward your goals.</li>
  </ol>
