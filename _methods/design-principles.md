title: Design principles
description: Written statements, generally in the form of imperatives like &ldquo;Earn people&rsquo;s trust,&rdquo; that serve as guiding lights during decision-making.
category: Decide
what: Written statements, generally in the form of imperatives like &ldquo;Earn people&rsquo;s trust,&rdquo; that serve as guiding lights during decision-making.
why: To give the team and the stakeholders a shared point of reference when negotiating next steps. Good design principles are specific to the project, not general truths, and should help teams say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to otherwise interesting proposals or generate ideas when they&rsquo;re stuck.
timeRequired: 1 week, plus occasional refresher meetings
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Using internal documents and kickoff activities, gather terms or concepts that seem significant to project goals and organizational culture.</li>
    <li>Using existing research, list terms or concepts that seem particularly important to customers or user groups.</li>
    <li>Cluster similar terms and concepts together on a whiteboard or other writing space open to everyone in the project. Name the clusters.</li>
    <li>Ask the team and stakeholders if they would like to add, change, or edit any concepts or groups.</li>
    <li>From the groups on the board, create three to five final principles. Using evidence from partner or user research, write one to two sentences in support of each principle.</li>
    <li>Share the principles in a place accessible to the team throughout the project, and refer to them often while making decisions.</li>
  </ol>

governmentConsiderations:
  <p>No PRA implications. Generally, no information is collected from members of the public. Even when stakeholders are members of the public, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey), 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3. See the methods for <a href="/recruiting">Recruiting</a> and <a href="/privacy">Privacy</a> for more tips on taking input from the public.</p>
