title: Incentives
category: Fundamentals
what: Offering usability test or user research participants gifts to encourage participation and to thank them for their time.
why: Incentives often result in a more diverse, representative set of participants. Without incentives, you often end up recruiting people with a strong intrinsic interest in your website. These people may not have the same needs and experiences as a less interested but larger pool of users. With incentives, you can encourage less interested, more representative people to participate.
timeRequired: 1-2 hours
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Gather three to six members of the project team who are ready to think on their feet. If possible, identify a few users who can play along.</li>
    <li>Bring the project team to the user&rsquo;s environment. If that&rsquo;s not practical, model the user&rsquo;s environment in a conference room.</li>
    <li>Assign each member of the project team to a role, interface, or &ldquo;touchpoint&rdquo; that you have identified in a <a href="/journey-mapping/">journey map</a>. If users are present, ask them to pretend to accomplish their goals as usual. Otherwise, assign a <a href="/personas/">persona</a> to each member of the product team who isn&rsquo;t serving as a touchpoint. If you anticipate discomfort, assign roles in advance and start with a basic script.</li>
    <li>Use props to role play how users accomplish their goals. &ldquo;Speak the interface&rdquo; to one another. For example, one of the touchpoints might say &ldquo;Submit all of your required forms,&rdquo; and the user might respond &ldquo;Arg! I donâ€™t know what forms are required!&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Review the exercise as a team and document the opportunities/challenges that this exercise suggests.</li>
  </ol>
governmentConsiderations:
  <ul>
    <li>No PRA implications. Even when users are present, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3.</li>
    <li>If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.</li>  
  </ul>
