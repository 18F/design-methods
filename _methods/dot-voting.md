what: A simple voting exercise to identify a group’s collective priorities for potential features.
why: To reach a consensus on priorities of subjective, qualitative data with a group of people. This is especially helpful with larger groups of stakeholders and groups with high risk of disagreement.
timeRequired: 15 minutes
how:
  - Bring plenty of sticky notes and colored stickers to the meeting.
  - Gather everyone on the product team and anyone with a stake in the product’s features.
  - Quickly review the project’s goals and the conclusions of any prior user research.
  - Ask team members to take five minutes to write important features or user needs on sticky notes. (One feature per sticky note.)
  - After five minutes, ask participants to put their stickies on a board. If there are many sticky notes, ask participants to put their features next to similar ones. Remove exact duplicates.
  - Give participants three to five colored stickers and instruct them to place their stickers on features they feel are most important to meeting the project's goals and user needs.
  - Identify the features with the largest number of stickers (votes).
