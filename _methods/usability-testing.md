## How to do it

1. Pick what you’ll test. Create a [prototype](/prototyping/) that conveys the team’s [design hypothesis](/design-hypothesis/). Alternatively, consider using a set of concepts, sketches, or even a competitor’s product.
1. Plan the test. Setup a meeting and invite anyone who has an interest in what you’d like to test (using discretion, of course. Align the group on the scenarios the test will center around, and how you’ll [recruit](/recruiting/) participants.
1. Recruit users and inform their consent. Pass along to participants an [agreement](/participant-agreement/) explaining what their participation will entail. Clarify any logistical expectations, such as screen sharing, and pass along links or files of whatever it is you're testing.
1. Run 3-6 sessions. Stick to your script ([example](/usability-test-script/)) and ask participants to think out loud. Review this [interview checklist](/interview-checklist/).
1. Discuss the results. After each interview, engage your team mates in a [post-interview debrief](/interview-debrief/). Maintain a [rolling issues log](/rolling-issues-log/).

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. First, any given usability test should involve nine or fewer users. Additionally, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3. It also specifically excludes tests of knowledge or aptitude, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)7, which is essentially what a usability test tests. See the methods for [Recruiting](/recruiting/) and [Privacy](/privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
