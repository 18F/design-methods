## How to do it

<ol>
  <li>Identify what the group hopes to accomplish.</li>
  <li>Identify the “core team,” the group of people who will directly participate in the design process. Unless the initiative is small, members of the core team will need to act as representatives for larger groups of stakeholders; for example, designers will often be asked to speak on behalf of users and their needs. Note: The core team will likely change over time!</li>
  <li>
    Think about how you’ll get there. Participatory design requires consensus building, which often means running frequent meetings and/or workshops. Also consider:
    <ul>  
      <li>Drafting a team charter outlining what’s being decided, who’s taking part, and how decisions will be made.</li>
      <li>Sharing meeting and workshop agendas before these events take place. </li>
      <li>Educating teammates on any shared knowledge or skills they’ll need to participate. </li>
      <li>Documenting and socializing any decisions made during meetings or workshops.</li>
      <li>Holding critiques and retrospectives to encourage blameless feedback throughout the process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
