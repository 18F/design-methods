title: Prototyping

goal: Develop

talk-to: Andrew Maier

what: |
  <p>A rudimentary version of something designed to exhibit form and function in a realistic way.</p>

why: |
  <p>To explore a design’s feasibility, to simulate context and generate questions.</p>

how: |
  <p>Prototypes allow designers to create a bridge between (1) their ability to execute, (2) their developer’s perceived limitations regarding the interface, and (3) their stakeholders’ feedback. Before beginning, prototypers must first consider the appropriate level of fidelity that will create a space in which all three of these parties can benefit. Some designers opt for “static” prototypes, using paper and simulating interaction; others actually go so far as to mockup an interface in InVision or to code a version of their interface in HTML and CSS. Regardless, the point is to create something that’s highly malleable that can change in response to feedback (via usability testing, say).</p>

in-context: |
  <p>No PRA implications.</p>
