title: Mental modeling

goal: Discover

talk-to: Andrew Maier

what: |
  <p>Considering how user interfaces affect user behaviors.</p>

why: |
  <p>To help designers anticipate and triage how particular design decisions might inform or facilitate future behavior.</p>


how: |
  <ol>
    <li>Create one, three-columned table per persona. Label the columns “Past,” “Present behavior,” “Future.”</li>
    <li>In the middle column (“present behavior”), list the user’s current behaviors and pain points, one per row.</li>
    <li>In the left-hand column (“past”), list the products, services, features, and/or interfaces that the user encounters as they get things done.</li>
    <li>In the right-hand column (“future”), list the proposed products, services, features, and/or interface elements that a user might use to get things done.</li>
    <li>Discuss the spaces between the columns. Think about how various aspects of the product’s interface shape its user’s understanding. Incorporate this information back into the project’s scope.</li>
  </ol>
