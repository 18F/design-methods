category: Decide
what: A detailed review of existing experiences provided either by direct competitors or by related agencies or services.
why: To identify competitors’ solutions that excel, are lacking, or are missing critical design elements. Comparative analysis can give you a competitive edge by identifying opportunities, gaps in other services, and potential design patterns to adopt or avoid.
timeRequired: 1–2 hours to analyze and write an evaluation about each competitor.
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Identify a list of services that would be either direct or related competitors to your service.  Pare the list down to four or five.</li>
    <li>Establish which criteria or heuristics you will use to evaluate each competing service.</li>
    <li>Break down the analysis of each selected competitor into specific focal areas for evaluation. For example, how relevant are search results?</li>
    <li>Use a spreadsheet to capture the evaluation and determine how the targeted services and agencies perform based on the identified heuristics.</li>
    <li>Present the analysis, which should showcase areas of opportunities that you can take advantage of and design patterns you might adopt or avoid.</li>  
  </ol>
