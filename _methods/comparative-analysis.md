title: Comparative analysis
category: Decide
what: A detailed review of existing experiences provided either by direct competitors or by related agencies or services.
why: To identify competitors’ solutions that excel, are lacking, or are missing critical design elements. Comparative analysis can give new solutions a competitive edge by identifying areas of opportunity, gaps in experience offerings, and potential design patterns to adopt or avoid.
timeRequired: 1–2 hours per identified competitor. One hour to analyze each competitor. 4–8 hours total to generate a report.
how:
  - Identify a list of services or agencies that would be either direct or related competitors to the service or client agency. Pare the list down to four or five.
  - Establish which heuristics you will use to evaluate each service or agency offering.
  - Break down the analysis of each selected competitor into specific focal areas for evaluation. For example, how relevant are search results?
  - Use a spreadsheet to capture the evaluation and determine how the targeted services and agencies perform based on the identified heuristics.
  - Present the analysis, which should showcase areas of opportunities that you can take advantage of and design patterns you might adopt or avoid.
governmentConsiderations: 
  No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
