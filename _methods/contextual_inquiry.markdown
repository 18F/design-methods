title: Contextual Inquiry
goal: Discover
expert: ——

what: <p>Contextual inquiry blends traditional stakeholder interviewing with ethnographic observation. You observe users performing their tasks in context, and ask them questions about what they are doing as they do it.</p>

why: <p>To understand how and why users do things and don’t do things.</p>
<p>Contextual inquiry allows you to gather data from a user with as little environmental interference as possible. This makes it is a useful tool if subjects are wary about participating in research because it would take too much time away from their work. </p>

how: |
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Usually there is only one observer per user. Start building rapport by telling the user the reason for your research, and ask them to introduce their work to you. Start recording, if they have given you permission.</li> 
	<li>Ask the user to carry on with their tasks as usual, but let them know that you will be occasionally interrupting them with questions. Use basic good manners about this. For instance, do not interrupt them with a question when they are on the phone with someone else. Your questions should help you understand what they are doing and why they are making their choices.</li>
	<li>At the end of the session, reflect back on what you have learned with the user and ask them to point out anything that was misunderstood. Clarify any outstanding questions.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

gov-context: 
	<p>No PRA implications, if done properly. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (1320.3.H.3). Worth noting: proper contextual interviews will rely on a conversation guide that helps the facilitator guide the conversation to get insight into the user’s behavior, goals and processes, but should not be a survey-like question and answer session, which indeed would be covered by the PRA. </p>
