title: Contextual inquiry

goal: Discover

talk-to: Elizabeth Goodman, Andrew Maier, Jesse Taggert 

what: |
  <p>Members from all parts of the product team observe users in context and ask questions to better understand their behavior.</p>

why: |
  <p>To understand how and why users do what they do in their own environment and to discover needs and attitudes that would not be surfaced in an interview format.</p>
  <p>This method is especially useful for subjects with concerns about the time required to sit down for an interview, or their work involves many or complex touchpoints with the product or solution that the project focuses on. </p>

how: |
  <ol>
    <li>Identify users to observe. Get permission (with government users, it is important to respect the supervisor hierarchy), schedule a time, and provide plenty of friendly reminders. Before the meeting, learn the dress code or other requirements to blend in.</li>
    <li>Travel to the user’s work environment (or setup time for remote research). Bring a pen, notebook, recording device, and a phone or camera.</li>
    <li>Assign one researcher per user and ask for permission to record the session. Build rapport with users by telling them the reason for your research. Ask them to explain their work as though they were training a new employee. </li>
    <li>Ask the user to carry on with their tasks as usual. Let them know that you will be occasionally interrupting them with questions to better understand what they are doing and why. (Be polite, of course.)</li>
    <li>Ask lots of “how” questions, or keep asking “why is that?” to get deeper insights. </li>
    <li>At the end of the session, explain what you have learned. Ask users to point out anything that you may have misunderstood.</li>
    <li>Immediately after the interview, write up your notes. Consider what outputs would best benefit from the research. User Journey, Persona, etc. </li>
  </ol>

in-context: |
  <p>No PRA implications, if done properly. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (1320.3.H.3). Contextual interviews may rely on a conversation guide that helps the facilitator guide the conversation to get insight into the user’s behavior, goals and processes, but should not be a survey-like question and answer session, which indeed <em>would</em> be covered by the PRA. </p>
  <p>A pair of 18Fers visited two Dept of Labor/Wage Hour Division Investigators as they interviewed home health care workers who were not getting paid overtime and other infractions. Since it was a sensitive subject, the 18F team did not question the health care workers directly, but instead asked the investigators clarifying questions in private. 18F staff also made sure that photos avoided faces. </p>
