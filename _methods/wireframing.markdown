title: Wireframing

goal: Define

talk-to: Andrew Maier

what: |
  <p>Lightweight, visual representations of a product or service.</p>

why: |
  <p>Low-fidelity design forces teams to prioritize information (substance) over decoration (style).</p>

how: |
    <p>Wireframes are blueprints. Steer clear of font choices, color, or other style choices. A few helpful tools for building wireframes are OmniGraffle and Balsamiq Mockups, which purposefully keep the wireframe looking like rough sketches. These are conceptually easier to re-configure than a design that looks very polished.</p> 
    <p>While making wireframes, it is useful to keep personas—and, specifically, their goals—in mind. Can people accomplish their tasks given the design you’re suggesting?</p>

in-context: No <abbr title="paperwork reduction act">PRA</abbr> implications.
