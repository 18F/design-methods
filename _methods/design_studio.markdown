title: Design studio

goal: Discover

talk-to: Erica Deahl, Andrew Maier, John Yuda

what: |
  <p>A visual way of facilitating communication (and brainstorming) between a project team and its stakeholders.</p>

why: |
  <p>To create a shared understanding and appreciation of the design problems confronting the project team.</p>

how: |
  <ol>
    <li>Invite 6-12 participants: stakeholders, users, and project team members who need to build a shared understanding. Let invitees know ahead of time what design prompt they will be asked to think through. Share any applicable research already conducted. Unless users will be present, share personas summarizing what users are trying to do and why.</li>
    <li>
      At the meeting: 
      <ol>
        <li>Review the design prompt and research shared.</li>
        <li>Distribute paper and drawing materials to everyone. Ask participants to individually sketch concepts that address the prompt. Remind them that anyone can draw and artistic accuracy is not the goal of the exercise. 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In groups of three, have participants present their ideas to one another and solicit critiques.</li>
        <li>Ask the groups of three to create a design(s) that combines the best aspects of their individual memberâ€™s contributions. </li>
        <li>Regroup as a whole. Have each group of three present their ideas to everyone. Discuss. </li>        
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>After the meeting, make note of areas that participants consistently agreed or disagreed on. Incorporate areas of contention into the research plan and areas of consensus into design recommendations.</li>
  </ol>
