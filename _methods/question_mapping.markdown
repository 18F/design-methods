title: Question mapping

goal: Discover

talk-to: Elizabeth Goodman

what: |
  <p>Grouping the questions stakeholders have around research.</p>

why: |
  <p>To identify parts of the interaction that are hurdles. To generate new ideas for solutions that are grounded in the physical experience of the problem. Also, physical interactions generate empathy!</p>

how: |
  <p>Start with either your personas or the raw data from contextual inquiry you have performed.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the perspective of each user, persona, or stakeholder, list each question that those people have around your inquiry area on sticky notes—one question per sticky. Use different colors for each persona type.</li>
    <li>Add in your own questions on sticky notes in a new color (If you don’t have that many colors, try cutting them into shapes, adding unique borders, or labeling them in another way).</li>
    <li>Cluster related questions. </li>  
  </ol>
  <p>At this point, you will notice how questions from different stakeholders relate or diverge from one another. This can create consensus among different groups (users vs management) but also illuminate very different perspectives in some cases.</p>

in-context: |
  <p>No PRA implications.</p>
