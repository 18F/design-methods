title: Diary study

goal: Discover

talk-to: Andrew Maier 

why: <p>To passively explore a user’s perspective, over time. This is especially useful for situations that require users to adapt their approach based on feedback from their environment, such as when they’re learning to use a new piece of software.</p>

how: |
    <ol>
      <li>Determine the duration of the process you'd like to gain insight into, how often you’ll ask users to write entries, as well as the format their entries should take (open-ended, text-based formats are the logical choice, but you might also consider handwritten notebooks, narrated videos, or photos with commentary).</li>
      <li>Recruit users by asking them to opt in. Many forms of research have designers sit alongside users while they’re accomplishing a task. Diary studies are a bit different because they’re spread out over time. Diary studies shouldn’t be thought of as a chore that’s above and beyond someone’s already busy schedule (though they are), so it’s important to recruit people who are excited to share their thoughts.</li>
      <li>Send participants prompts at regular intervals throughout the study. Consider periodically checking in on participants to see how they’re feeling. </li>
      <li>Synthesize the research as it’s collected rather than waiting until the end of the study.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Diary studies conducted ahead of in-person interviews allow researchers to poke deeper into certain response areas and ask follow-up questions.</p>
