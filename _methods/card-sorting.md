title: Card sorting
description: A categorization exercise in which participants divide concepts into different groups based on their
category: Validate
what: A categorization exercise in which participants divide concepts into different groups based on their understanding of those concepts.
why: To create content structures that are user-informed and intuitive.
timeRequired: 15â€“30 minutes per user
how:
  <p>There are two types of card sorting&#58; open and closed. Most card sorts are performed with one user at a time, but you can also do the exercise with groups of two to three people.</p>
  <h2>Open card sort</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Give users a collection of content represented on cards.</li>
    <li>Ask users to separate the cards into whatever categories make sense to them.</li>
    <li>Ask users to label those categories.</li>
    <li>Ask users to tell you why they grouped the cards and labeled the categories as they did.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Closed card sort</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Give users a collection of content represented on cards.</li>
    <li>Ask users to parse the content into a list of categories you have predefined.</li>
    <li>Ask users to tell you why they assigned cards to the categories they did.</li>
  </ol>

governmentConsiderations:
  <p>No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3. It also explicitly excludes tests of knowledge or aptitude, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)7, which is essentially what a card sort tests (though in our case, a poor result is our fault).</p>
