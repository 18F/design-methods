category: Decide
what: A visual sequence of a specific use case or scenario, coupled with a narrative.
why: To visualize interactions and relationships that might exist between a user and a solution in the context of the user’s full experience.
timeRequired: 1–2 days depending on the complexity of the scenario(s)
how:
  - Gather any documents that describe the different use cases or [scenarios]({{ '/decide/user-scenarios/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in which users will interact with your service.
  - Sketch scenes that visually depict a user interacting with the service, including as much context as possible. For example: Are they on the move? Where are they? What else is in their environment?
  - Annotate each scene with a description of what the user is attempting to do. Describe what general feeling or experience the team wants the user to have.
  - Review this storyboard with the product team and stakeholders for feedback. Iterate until the storyboard represents a shared vision of the scenario and progression of scenes.
  - Create a polished version of the storyboard if you plan to use it for future work or in other external contexts.
governmentConsiderations:
  No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
