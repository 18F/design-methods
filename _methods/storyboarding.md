what: A visual sequence of a specific use case or scenario, coupled with a narrative.
why: To visualize interactions and relationships that might exist between a user and a solution in the context of the user&rsquo;s full experience.
timeRequired: 1â€“2 days depending on the complexity of the scenario(s)
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Gather any documents that describe the different use cases or <a href="/user-scenarios">scenarios</a> in which users will interact with your service.</li>
    <li>Sketch scenes that visually depict a user interacting with the service, including as much context as possible. For example&#58; Are they on the move? Where are they? What else is in their environment?</li>
    <li>Annotate each scene with a description of what the user is attempting to do. Describe what general feeling or experience the team wants the user to have.</li>
    <li>Review this storyboard with the product team and stakeholders for feedback. Iterate until the storyboard represents a shared vision of the scenario and progression of scenes.</li>
    <li>Create a polished version of the storyboard if you plan to use it for future work or in other external contexts.</li>
  </ol>
