title: Bodystorming

goal: Discover

talk-to: Andrew Maier

what: <p>Improvisational brainstorming with the body. </p>

why: <p>To remind participants that interactions are human and physical, to teach stakeholder empathy, and to get away from our computers.</p>

how: |
    <ol>
      <li>Gather 3-6 members of the project team who are ready to think on their feet. If possible, identify a few users who can play along. </li>
      <li>Bringing the project team to the user&rsquo;s environment is ideal, but a conference room that models the user&rsquo;s environment could also work. </li>
      <li>Assign each member of the project team to a role, interface, or &ldquo;touchpoint,&rdquo; identified in the journey map. If users are present, ask them to pretend to accomplish their goals in their usual way. If users are absent, assign a persona to each member of the product team that isn&rsquo;t serving as a touchpoint. </li>
      <li>Role play how users accomplish their goals using props. &ldquo;Speak the interface&rdquo; to one another. For example, one of the touchpoints might say &ldquo;Submit all of your required forms,&rdquo; and the user might respond &ldquo;Arg! I don&rsquo;t know what forms are required!&rdquo; </li>
      <li>Review the exercise as a team and document the opportunities/challenges that this exercise suggests.</li>
      <li>If you anticipate discomfort from participants, assign roles beforehand and start with a basic script.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tip: If you anticipate discomfort from participants, assign roles beforehand and start with a basic script.</p>

considerations: |
  <ul>
    <li>No PRA implications. Even when users are present, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that bodystorming entails. (1320.3.H.3). </li>
    <li>If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.</li>
  </ul>
