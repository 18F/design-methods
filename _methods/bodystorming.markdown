expert: Andrew Maier
gov-context: No PRA implications. Even when users are present, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that bodystorming entails. (1320.3.H.3)
That means: Storm away, no PRA needed!

title: Bodystorming
goal: Discover

what: <p>Bodystorming is brainstorming with the body. It’s an improvisational exercise that helps members of the project team transform themselves into members of the community being served, allowing them to better conceive of contextually relevant solutions to complex problems.</p>

why: <p>Great user experiences are often praised for being invisible and indistinguishable from magic. Bodystorming helps teams capitalize on this ideal state by obfuscating the design of a user interface altogether. Also, the physical act of embodying the solution generates empathy.</p>

how: |
    <ol>
      <li>Gather 3-6 members of the product team who are ready to think on their feet. If possible, identify a few users who can play along.</li>
      <li>Determine where you’ll hold the session. Bringing the project team to the user’s environment is ideal. A conference room that models that environment could also work. Record the session.</li>
      <li>Assign each member of the product team to one of the interfaces, or “touchpoints,” identified in your user’s journey. If users are present, ask them to pretend to accomplish their goals in their usual way. If users are absent, assign a persona to each member of the product team that isn’t serving as a touchpoint.</li>
      <li>Use role play and props to help users accomplish their goals. The idea is to “speak the interface” to one another. For example, you might say “Give me a list of all of the forms submitted in the past week.”</li>
      <li>Review the exercise as a team. Document some of the potential opportunities/challenges that this exercise suggests.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tip: If you anticipate discomfort from participants, it may be helpful to assign roles beforehand and start with a basic script.</p>
