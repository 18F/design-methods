title: Card Sorting
goal: Discover
expert: Noah Manger, Andrew Maier

what: <p>Card sorting provides users with a means of telling designers how they think about the information comprising our designs.</p>

why: <p>Card sorting is a useful tool for helping designers create and structure content in a consistent, intuitive way.</p>

how: |
    <p>There are two types of card sorting, open and closed. An open card sort is an exercise in which users are given a set of content and asked to group that content into whatever categories make sense. Users are then asked to label those categories. A closed card sort is the same thing, except users are given a predefined list of categories into which they should sort the content. Regardless of whether your card sort is open or closed, ask users to tell you about why they chose the categories they chose.</p>

gov-context: 
	<p>No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (1320.3.H.3). It also specifically excludes tests of knowledge or aptitude (1320.3.H.7), which is essentially what a card sort tests (though in our case a poor result is our fault). That means: Sort away, no PRA clearance needed!</p>
