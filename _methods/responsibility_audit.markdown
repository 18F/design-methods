why: <p>To identify parts of the interaction that are hurdles. To generate new ideas for solutions that are grounded in the physical experience of the problem. Also, physical interactions generate empathy!</p>

how: |
    <p>There are three levels of bodystorming, choose the level that’s right for the group and incorporates the right level of discomfort for a new group and new activity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Level 1: Go to the site you are studying, and do your work as normal. Don’t do any analysis, but be open to environmental cues and information that come from the observation.</li>
      <li>Level 2: Use role play and props to start thinking through a new idea. Assign roles to people, making them either personas or objects, abstract or physical. It may be helpful for first-timers to assign the roles beforehand and start with a basic script.</li>
      <li>Level 3:  Reflect on what happens, and why.</li>
    </ul>
