goal: Define

What: <p>A facilitated exercise in which participants list their individual priorities onto cards, collect them as a group, organize them by relationship, and establish group priorities through individual voting.</p>

why: <p>To identify parts of the interaction that are hurdles. To generate new ideas for solutions that are grounded in the physical experience of the problem. Also, physical interactions generate empathy!</p>

how: |
  <ol>
    <li>Determine a focus question (e.g., what did we learn from the usability study?) and assign a facilitator.</li>
    <li>Gather at least 4 participants for 90 minutes. Give sticky notes (in at least two different colors) and sharpies to everyone. </li>
    <li>Ask participants the focus question and give them five minutes to think of at least three responses. Put each response on its own sticky note.</li>
    <li>Give participants 15 minutes puts their sticky notes up on the wall and read everyone’s contributions. Additions can be made at any time.</li>
    <li>Have participants group like items without any discussion of the sticky notes or the groups. </li>
    <li>Using a different colored sticky note, ask each individual to name each group. Each group must have a name, but you may realize that a group could be split into two. The only time you’re excused from giving a group a name is if someone has already used the exact words you had intended to use.</li>
    <li>Remind the group of the original focus question. Each person writes down their three most important groups in order of priority. Assign 3 votes to 1st priority, 2 votes to 2nd priority, and 1 vote to 3rd priority, which totals 6 votes over 3 topics. These votes should be visually tallied on the clusters, with either stickers or pen marks.</li>
    <li>Eliminate any duplicate areas, but only if the group unanimously agrees that they are identical. Every time two items are combined, their votes are added together. Usually, you reach a point where there are three or four items which are ranked much higher than the rest. These are the top priorities for the focus question.</li>    
  </ol>

in-context: |
  <p>18F used this exercise with a group of 20 FEC staff members when they needed to define priorities around conflicting requests. We used this method to get some data from the staff (not the decision makers) about what they saw as the most pressing needs. This information was processed, synthesized, and then presented back to the decision makers.</p>
