title: Cognitive walkthrough
category: Discover
what: An evaluation method in which evaluators work through a set of representative tasks and ask questions about the task as they go.
why: To get quick and early feedback on whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it is or isn’t easy. This method i useful for catching big issues at any stage in the design process when you don't have access to real users, but it is not a substitute for user evaluation.
timeRequired: 30 minutes to one hour per person
how:
  - Identify specific traits for new or infrequent users of a design solution.
  - Develop a set of representative tasks that emphasize new use or infrequent use.
  - Designate a member of the design team to play the role of a user who has the traits you’ve identified to participate in a moderated usability testing session. (The traits can overlap.)
  - Ask the user to accomplish their goal using a printed or interactive design. As they go, ask what they would attempt to do next or how they would learn. <ul><li>Don't lead the user through the task, but encourage them to stay focused on what they’re trying to accomplish.</li><li>Pay attention to expected outcomes and how quickly/easily participants are able to pick up a task.</li></ul>
  - Analyze the walkthrough results to highlight where the user struggled and what needs improvement.
governmentConsiderations:
  - No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation (e.g., not a survey) that a cognitive walkthrough entails, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3.
  - If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
