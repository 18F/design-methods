title: Personas
goal: Discover

talk-to: Andrew Maier

what: 

why: <p>To identify parts of the interaction that are hurdles. To generate new ideas for solutions that are grounded in the physical experience of the problem. Also, physical interactions generate empathy!</p>

how: |
  <p>Personas are usually created as part of the analysis of the data generated from a team’s contextual inquiry and stakeholder interviews.  Teams can certainly create placeholder personas in the absence of this research, but they’re effectively stereotyping users. Placeholder personas are nevertheless useful for getting a team to think critically about its users, but they should not be used to inform design decisions.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather your research in a way that’s easy to review.</li>
    <li>Create a set of user archetypes based on how you believe people will make use of your solution. These typically take an active title (e.g., “data administrators” versus “those who submit data”).</li>
    <li>Analyze your records for patterns as they relate to user archetypes. Specifically note frequently observed goals/motivations, behaviors, and pain points.</li>
    <li>Pair recurring goals, behaviors, and pain points with archetypes. Give each archetype a name as well as a fictional account of their day. Add a photo of someone who fits the description, but ideally not an image of someone you’ve actually interviewed and who may be recognized.</li>
    <li>Link your personas to the research that inspired them. This is useful when researchers are interested in challenging the way a persona stereotypes a user.</li>  
  </ol>
  <p>Note: Unlike marketing personas, which are often created based on demographics and marketability, design personas are tools describing how someone goes about accomplishing their goals. </p>

in-context: <p>No PRA Implications. Personas don’t require collection of structured information from the public. Neither do the stakeholder or contextual interviews that are its base data.</p>
