title: KJ method
category: Discover
what: A facilitated exercise in which participants list their individual priorities onto cards, collect them as a group, organize them by relationship, and establish group priorities through individual voting.
why: To reach a consensus on priorities of subjective, qualitative data with a group of people. This is especially helpful with larger groups of stakeholders and groups with high risk of disagreement.
timeRequired: 1–2 hours
how:
- Gather four or more participants for 90 minutes. Provide sticky notes and markers.
- Create a focused question about the project's needs and select a facilitator to run the exercise.
- Give participants five minutes to write at least three responses to the question, each on its own note.
- Give participants 15 minutes to put their answers on the wall, read everyone else’s, and make additions. Have participants cluster similar answers without discussion.
- Ask participants to write names for each cluster on their own — this is mandatory. They may also split clusters.
- Put each name on the wall by its cluster. Exclude word-for-word duplicates.
- Reiterate the question and have each person rank their three most important clusters. Visually tally points.
- Combine duplicates and their points if the entire group agrees they’re identical. Three or four groups usually rank higher than the rest — these are the priorities for the question.
