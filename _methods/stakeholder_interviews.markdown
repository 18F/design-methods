title: Site mapping

goal: Discover

talk-to: Jeremy Canfield, Andrew Maier, Elizabeth Goodman, Jesse Taggert

what: |
  <p>Semi-structured interviews with anyone who has an interest in the project’s success, including users.</p>

why: |
  <p>To build consensus about the problem statement and research objectives.</p>

how: |
  <p>These interviews typically last for about an hour and are conducted either one-on-one, or two-on-one with an additional note-taker or joint interviewer.</p>
  <p>Come to the interview with an guide for yourself of some question areas you’d like to ask about, and some specific questions as a back up. Once you introduce yourself and start the interview, follow the conversational direction that the stakeholder leads you in. What they focus on will be insightful to their priorities and interests. Don’t get entirely off course though, your interview guide will help you make sure that you are checking in on what you need to. Questions will often fall in categories around the individual and their role, the organization, the individuals’ needs, and metrics for success of the project. Possible starters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
    <li>Ask lots of "why is that" and "how" questions. Be comfortable with long silences which will allow the stakeholder to elaborate on their own.</li>
    <li>If there are other products they use or your product is greenfield then observe them using a competing product.</li>
  </ul>

in-context: |
  <p>No PRA implications.</p>
