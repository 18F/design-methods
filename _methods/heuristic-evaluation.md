title: Heuristic evaluation
permalink: /discover/heuristic-evaluation/
description: A quick way to find common, large usability problems on a website.
category: Discover
what: A quick way to find common, large usability problems on a website.
why: To quickly identify common design problems that make websites hard to use without conducting more involved user research.
timeRequired: 1â€“2 hours
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Recruit a group of three to five people familiar with evaluation methods. These people are not necessarily designers, but are familiar with common usability best practices. They are usually not users.</li>  
    <li>
      Ask each person to individually create a list of &ldquo;heuristics&rdquo; or general usability best practices. Examples of heuristics from Nielsen&rsquo;s &ldquo;10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design&rdquo; include&#58;
      <ul>
        <li> The website should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</li>
        <li> The system should speak the user&rsquo;s language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.</li>
        <li>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &ldquo;emergency exit&rdquo; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ask each person to evaluate the website against their list and write down possible problems.</li>
    <li>After individual evaluations, gather people to discuss what they found and prioritize potential problems.</li>
  </ol>

governmentConsiderations:
  <p>No PRA Implications, as heuristic evaluations usually include a small number of evaluators. If conducted with nine or fewer members of the public, the PRA does not apply, 5 CFR 1320.5(c)4. If participants are employees, the PRA does not apply. See the methods for <a href="/fundamentals/recruiting/">Recruiting</a> and <a href="/fundamentals/privacy"/>Privacy</a> for more tips on taking input from the public.</p>
