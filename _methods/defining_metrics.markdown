title: Defining metrics

goal: Define

talk-to: Nick Brethauer, Michelle Hertzfeld, Josh Ruihley, Victor Zapanta

what: |
  <p>Collaboratively defining the problem(s) by which team a team will measure its impact.</p>

why: |
  <p>Metrics keep a team vigilant and can be passively measured over time.</p>

how: |
  <p>Work with your team to collaboratively craft a problem statement: </p>

  <blockquote><p>We have observed that [product/service/organization] isn’t meeting [these goals/needs], which is causing [this adverse effect]. How might we improve so that our team/organization is more successful based on [these measurable criteria]?</p></blockquote>
  
  <p>Some tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our success metrics are often the same metrics that make us appear good at our job. But being good at our job isn’t enough. Research keeps us vigilant by helping us see and hear things from the perspective of our users.</li>
    <li>Use personas to identify users’ skills, practices, and behaviors. Decide which of these you want to promote (and how you would measure that). Next, look at your persona’s pain points and consider how you would alleviate them (and how you would measure that).</li>
    <li>Anonymously collect your teammates’ greatest hopes as well as their greatest fears. Print these out, group them by topic, and discuss. Think about ways of measuring, throughout the project, whether or not the project is aligning with your collective hopes or deviating towards your collective fears.</li>
  </ul>
