title: Usability testing

goal: Develop

talk-to: Elizabeth Goodman, Andrew Maier

what: |
  <p>Observing people as they attempt to use a product.</p>

why: |
  <p>To learn a given design’s challenges, opportunities, and successes.</p>

how: |
  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a prototype that sufficiently conveys the team’s hypothesis based on research. In the absence of a prototype, consider testing a competitor’s product.
    </li>
    
  </ol>
  <li>
    <p>Stage a scenario in which someone who would actually use your product tries to employ the prototype for their own ends. Record their attempt. Optionally: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask users to think out loud.</li>
      <li>Pay the participant for their time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyze the user’s attempt to employ your prototype, looking especially for areas where they struggled or questions they asked to inform design changes.</li>  
  <p>While designers concern ourselves with the design of products and services, regular people use products and services to achieve their own goals (i.e., they don’t care about design). For this reason, it’s not really a good idea to offer test participants a large incentive or to take them far outside of their normal usage context. If you are a voter registration group testing a new layout for your website’s “user account section,” for example, you’d ideally recruit test participants who were already registering to vote online. You’d specifically want to avoid testing with voters who were unfamiliar with the website. Asking people to change their existing behavior for the purposes of a test will cause them to reflect and comment on the design rather than their ability to accomplish their goals in a way that’s familiar to them.</p>

in-context: |
  <p>No PRA implications.</p>
