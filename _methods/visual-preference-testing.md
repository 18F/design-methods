title: Visual preference testing
category: Validate
what: A method that allows potential users to review and provide feedback on a solution’s ultimate visual direction.
why: To align the established branding guidelines and attributes of a solution with the way end users view the overall brand and emotional feel.
timeRequired: 4-12 hours for mood boards or [style tiles]('/decide/style-tiles/'). 30 minutes per participant to get feedback.
how:
  <ol>
    <li>Create iterations of a mood board or style tile that represent directions a final visual design may follow. If branding guidelines or attributes don’t exist, establish them with stakeholders beforehand.</li>
    <li>Ask questions as objectively as possible. Align questions with the branding guidelines and attributes your project must incorporate.</li>
    <li>As far as possible, allow participants to provide their feedback unmoderated or at the end of a research study.</li>
    <li>Compare the results with the published branding guidelines and attributes that an agency has already put in place.</li>
    <li>Publish the results to the complete product team and decide which direction will guide future design efforts.</li>
  </ol>
