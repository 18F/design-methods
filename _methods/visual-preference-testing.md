1. Create iterations of a mood board or style tile that represent directions a final visual design may follow. If branding guidelines or attributes don’t exist, establish them with stakeholders beforehand.

2. Ask questions as objectively as possible. Align questions with the branding guidelines and attributes your project must incorporate.

3. As far as possible, allow participants to provide their feedback unmoderated or at the end of a research study.

4. Compare the results with the published branding guidelines and attributes that an agency has already put in place.

5. Publish the results to the complete product team and decide which direction will guide future design efforts.
