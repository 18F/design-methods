title: Heuristic analysis
category: Discover
what: A quick way to find common, large usability problems on a website.
why: To quickly identify common design problems that make websites hard to use without conducting more involved user research.
timeRequired: 1–2 hours
how:
- Recruit a group of three to five people familiar with evaluation methods. These people are not necessarily designers, but are familiar with common usability best practices. They are usually not users.
- Ask each person to individually create a list of “heuristics” or general usability best practices. Examples of heuristics from Nielsen’s “10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design” include
 <ul><li> The website should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</li>
 <li> The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.</li>
 <li>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.</li></ul>
- Ask each person to evaluate the website against their list and write down possible problems.
- After individual evaluations, gather people to discuss what they found and prioritize potential problems.
